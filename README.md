4. Launch "Performance Tracker" from app drawer

### For Developers
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone [repository-url]
cd PreformanceChecker

# Setup virtual environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Initialize database
python init_db.py

# Run on desktop for testing
python main.py

# Build Android APK
buildozer android debug
```

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Getting Started
1. **Create Tasks**: Tap "+" to add work tasks with target times
2. **Record Performance**: Enter actual completion times 
3. **Document Delays**: Record delays with detailed reasons
4. **Review History**: Track performance trends over time

### Best Practices
- **Record immediately** - Don't wait until end of shift
- **Be specific** - Detailed delay reasons are more credible
- **Stay consistent** - Regular use builds stronger evidence
- **Back up data** - Regular phone backups protect your records
