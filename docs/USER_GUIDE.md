**How to use**:
1. Find your task in the list and tap on it
2. On the task details screen, enter your **actual completion time**
3. The app automatically calculates your performance percentage:
   - **Over 100%** = You beat the target! ✅
   - **Under 100%** = Took longer than target ⚠️
4. Tap **"Record Performance"** to save

**Understanding Performance %**:
- **133%** = You completed in 45 minutes what should take 60 (Great job!)
- **80%** = You took 75 minutes for a 60-minute task (Room for improvement)
- **100%** = You hit the target exactly

## Protecting Yourself

### 📝 Best Practices for Documentation
1. **Record Everything**: Even small delays matter
2. **Be Specific**: "Machine malfunction" is good, "Conveyor belt motor failed, maintenance called at 2:15 PM" is better
3. **Record Immediately**: Don't wait until end of shift
4. **Take Screenshots**: Use your phone to capture error messages, maintenance logs, etc.

### 🛡️ Using Data to Defend Performance
**If questioned about performance**:
1. Open your app and show recorded data
2. Point out documented delays and their causes
3. Show your performance percentage trends
4. Demonstrate consistency in record-keeping

**Example Response**:
> "According to my Performance Tracker app, on March 15th I completed Task A in 52 minutes against a 60-minute target (115% performance). However, I also documented a 15-minute delay due to equipment malfunction, which I reported to maintenance at 10:30 AM."
